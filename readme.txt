Provides a table of event venues with automatic links to Google maps. Custom map links can also be created.

== Description ==

The MSTW Game Locations plugin is more appropriately named "Event Venues". It creates a table of locations/venues with links to maps for each one. The table is displayed via a simple shortcode, [mstw_gl_table]. Use the Add/Edit Game Location screen to enter the Location (as the title), the street address, city, state, and zip. The plug-in generates the link to that location on Google Maps from the street address, city, state, and zip. A Custom URL can be used to replace the link to Google Maps.

= NEW IN VERSION 1.3 =

Version 1.3 is a maintenance release. Some namespace collisions with other MSTW plugins were eliminated. Please read the release notes for more information.

= Notes =

* The Game Locations plugin is part of the My Sports Team Website (MSTW) framework for sports team and league websites. Others include Game Schedules, Team Rosters, Coaching Staffs, and League Standings, which are all available on [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins). [Learn more about MSTW](http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/my-sports-team-website/).

**Notes:**

* The references are to "game locations", only because that was original purpose of the plugin. However, perhaps "Event Venue" is a better term, and in fact the plugin works for any type of location - schools, churches, businesses, whatever.

* The current version of Game Locations has been tested on WP 3.9 with the Twentyeleven theme. If you use older version of WordPress, good luck! If you are using a newer version, please let me know how the plugin works, especially if you encounter problems.

* The Game Locations plugin is the first in a set of plugins supporting the MSTW Framework for sports team websites. Others currently include Coaching Staffs, Game Schedules, Team Rosters, and League Standings.
